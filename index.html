    <section class="main-section" id="Honor_System_and_NPC_Behavior">
      <header>Honor System and NPC Behavior</header>
      <p>The honor system reflects moral choices made throughout the game.</p>
      <p>Higher honor unlocks positive outcomes (lower store prices and trust from NPCs); lower honor leads to fear and hostility (higher prices and greater consequences for crime).</p>
      <p>NPCs remember actions and react differently depending on Arthurâ€™s honor level (you are rewarded for being a good person).</p>
      <p>Dynamic AI remembers player behavior and their reputation.</p>
